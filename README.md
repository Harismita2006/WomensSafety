OBJECTIVE
      The objective of this project is to design and develop an AI-integrated smart wearable (shoe) for women that can detect emergencies using pressure and button sensors, and instantly send alerts to contacts and nearby patrols, along with real-time location tracking and Gemini-generated safety tips.

FUNCTIONALITY
      Our system offers the following features:
      
      Emergency Detection: Tracks pressure and button triggers to identify distress.
      
      Real-Time Alerts: Sends alert messages to emergency contacts and nearby patrols.
      
      Geo-Zone Mapping: Displays green (safe) and red (unsafe/crime-prone) zones.
      
      Live Location Tracking: Shows current GPS location of the user in real-time.
      
      Community Support: Enables communication among users for collective safety.
      
      Safety Tips: Gemini AI generates personalized safety recommendations.
      
      Safety Product Store: Displays safety-related tools and kits for purchase.

USER FLOW
      Login/Registration: Users log in securely through the mobile app.
      
      Sensor Monitoring: Shoe continuously checks for high pressure or emergency button press.
      
      Alert Trigger: On detecting threat, an alert is sent via Firebase to the app.
      
      Live Tracking: The app shows live location and alert details to contacts and authorities.
      
      AI Safety Tips: Gemini API suggests actionable safety measures.
